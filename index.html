                <h1>What Is an LLP?</h1>
                <p>An LLP is a sort of hybrid corporate business structure that involves the integration of the advantages of a limited liability company with the flexibility of a partnership. Even if the partners opt to leave, the LLP can persist.  An LLP  can even enter into contracts and own property in its own capacity.</p>
                <p>This is because it is a separate legal entity having to bear the full liability for its assets, which makes it possible for partners’ liability to be limited to their agreed contribution to the LLP. Furthermore, no partner is held accountable for the independent or unapproved activity of other partners, thus partners are insulated from shared liability stemming from another partner’s illegal business decisions or malfeasance.</p>
                <p>To sum up, because of its flexibility in structure and operation, an LLP is an excellent vehicle for seeking venture capital investment.</p>
