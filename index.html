                <h1>What Is an LLP?</h1>
                <p>An LLP is a sort of hybrid corporate business structure that involves the integration of the advantages of a limited liability company with the flexibility of a partnership. Even if the partners opt to leave, the LLP can persist.  An LLP  can even enter into contracts and own property in its own capacity.</p>
                <p>This is because it is a separate legal entity having to bear the full liability for its assets, which makes it possible for partners’ liability to be limited to their agreed contribution to the LLP. Furthermore, no partner is held accountable for the independent or unapproved activity of other partners, thus partners are insulated from shared liability stemming from another partner’s illegal business decisions or malfeasance.</p>
                <p>To sum up, because of its flexibility in structure and operation, an LLP is an excellent vehicle for seeking venture capital investment.</p>

                <h1>What is GST Registration?</h1>
                <p>GST registration is a multi-stage tax levied at every point of sale. It has replaced several indirect taxes, including service tax, value-added tax, central sales tax, excise duty, and extra customs charge. GST was implemented as a result of the Goods and Services Act, which went into effect on July 1, 2017.</p>
                <p>While not all firms are expected to participate, there are several benefits to doing so. Firms that exceed a particular yearly turnover threshold however must mandatorily register.</p>
                <p>Initially, the GST Act required LLPs with yearly revenue of more than ₹20 lakhs to register as taxable entities. As of April 1, 2019, the limit for LLPs dealing in goods was raised to ₹40 lakhs. For Limited Liability Partnership companies providing services, however, the threshold level remains at ₹20 lakhs.</p>
